# Open Source

The development of HappyFeet has only been possible with the use of open source software, including
everything from tools used for hardware development ([KiCad](https://www.kicad.org), 
[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org)) 
to software packages ([flutter_blue](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue), 
[flutter_midi](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_midi)) to 
[soundfonts](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/).
So, we've stood on the shoulders of giants!  Now, it's our turn to give back.  We look forward
to suggestions/contributions from the user community.

## App

The HappyFeet app is developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), a cross-platform app development
environment, and the repo is [here].

## Embedded Software

The embedded software is based on the [Texas Instruments](https://ti.com) [simple_peripheral](http://software-dl.ti.com/simplelink/esd/simplelink_cc26x2_sdk/2.10.00.44/exports/examples/rtos/CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL/ble5stack/simple_peripheral/README.html)
example for [CC26xx Bluetooth system-on-a-chip](https://www.ti.com/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth/overview/overview.html).
The HappyFeet repo is [here].
