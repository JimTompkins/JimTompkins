# About

I'm an electronics engineer and also an advanced-beginner (i.e. not very good!) musician.  I believe music is the "killer app" 
and everyone has a desire to make some kind of music.  It touches something in your soul, and it is really
fun: after all, we say "playing" an instrument, not "working" one!

HappyFeet was created as an ultra-lean startup to develop a new product and create a user community around it.
We plan to do an initial rollout with a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) campaign, and then sell directly 
(Amazon is already big enough!).  Please subscribe to our mailing list to stay informed.
