# App Tour

## Home Screen

1. Press the Bluetooth connect icon to scan for nearby HappyFeet, and connect.
2. Select the play mode.  The choices are:
   1. Single note mode: the simplest mode.  In this mode, each time a beat is detected
   by HappyFeet, one note will be played.  This note is chosen by the "1st note" dropdown in the
   Notes section.
   2. Alternating note mode: in this mode, HappyFeet will alternate between two notes on
   each beat detected.  The two notes are chosen using the "1st note" and "2nd note" dropdowns in 
   the Notes section.
   3. Groove mode.  When this mode is selected, you will be taken to the Groove screen
   and will be able to define a groove.
3. Select the 1st and 2nd notes if using Single Note or Alternating Note play
4. Enable groove detection by pressing the "note" button.
