title: "What's all this latency stuff, anyhow?"

With a nod to Bob Pease (legendary analog circuit designer), today's post looks at the
latency from foot-tap to sound.  Sound travels at 1400m/s or 1.4m/ms, so each ms of latency (aka delay), 
equates to the sound coming from 1m away.  I've read some posts (such as this one)[link](https://calebdolister.medium.com/why-cant-musicians-jam-with-each-other-online-without-latency-or-other-issues-44260789a721)
related to on-line jamming
that say that latency effects become objectionable at 20-30ms.

I measured latency by making a sound recording and measuring the time between the sound of the foot tap and
the sound played by the app.

The first result was 250ms from the Android version of the app running on a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone.  Yikes!  Totally unacceptable!

Apparently Android's audio latency is a well known problem.  See [link](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/an-update-on-androids-audio-latency.html)
for a good exploration of audio latency in Android, including a timeline of how it's improved over time.

This version used the flutter_midi package as the sound engine.  I also tried audioplayers/audiocache and soundpool packages
with only slightly better results.  Finally, I settled on the flutter_ogg_piano package which achieves low latency by being "close"
to the underlying audio engine in Android using Oboe.  I measured the average latency with the same Samsung S7 of 19.75ms 
with a min of 10ms and a max of 30ms.

When these measurements were repeated on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A(2016) the results were quite a bit worse: 
mean of 95ms, min of 65ms and max of 134ms.  Clearly, older Android devices are a problem!

Stay tuned for results from the iOS version.
